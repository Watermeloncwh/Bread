        2. Hand kneaded and shaped in-house<br>
        3. Prepared over 14-17hrs<br>
        4. Organic flour, the water is filtered and the electricity<br>

        5. Store bought bread is mixed and baked within 2 hours meaning<br>
             the gluten content is really high and can lead to someone feeling
            clogged up when eating bread. Sourdough is a great alternative
            and much easier to digest.</p>
